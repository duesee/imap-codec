//! # 3. State and Flow Diagram
//!
//! Once the connection between client and server is established, an
//! IMAP4rev1 connection is in one of four states.  The initial
//! state is identified in the server greeting.  Most commands are
//! only valid in certain states.  It is a protocol error for the
//! client to attempt a command while the connection is in an
//! inappropriate state, and the server will respond with a BAD or
//! NO (depending upon server implementation) command completion
//! result.
